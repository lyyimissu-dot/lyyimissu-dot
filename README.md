# Hi, I'm Yu 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 5+ years of experience in automated material-handling equipment (stacker cranes, lifting platforms, welded structures).  
Currently I'm completing my MEng in Mechanical Engineering in Canada

## 🔧 Technical Focus
- Mechanical design: lifting equipment, welded frames, machined parts
- CAD: SolidEdge (advanced), SolidWorks, AutoCAD
- Analysis: basic FEA concepts, risk assessment (qualitative & quantitative)
- Coding (learning): Python for data analysis, simple automation scripts

## 📂 Featured Projects
- **Automated Stacker Crane Platform Design** – structural design, fabrication drawings, and BOMs  
- **Risk Assessment of Automated Logistics Equipment** – FMEA and quantitative risk evaluation  
- **(Coming soon)** 3D printing + machine learning project

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- North American drawing standards (GD&T, ASME Y14.5)
- Welding symbols (AWS / CSA)
- Python for engineering calculations
