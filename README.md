# Hi, I'm Yu Gan 👋  
**Mechanical Engineer | Automation & Machine Design | CAD & Simulation | Risk & Reliability**

I’m a Mechanical Engineer with 5 years of experience designing **automated material-handling machinery**, including stacker cranes, lifting systems, and industrial equipment.  
Currently completing my **MEng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Guelph (Canada)**, focusing on:

- Digital manufacturing & automation  
- Mechanical risk & reliability analysis  
- 3D printing optimization using ML-based methods  
- FEA / GD&T / DFM / DFA  
- Engineering project & process management  

I’m building this GitHub to share **engineering models, CAD-related workflows, analysis scripts, and small ML tools** I develop during study and personal projects.
